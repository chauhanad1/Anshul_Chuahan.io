Like majority of students around the world, I am also attracted towards infinte potential in the domain of computer science.

computer science gave me a new way to think about stuffs which we do on day to day basis and has increased my reasoning capabilities also helping me find logical alternatives of various situations.
	
I am an enthusiast who loves to try
things out of my comfort zones which keeps me moving in life. I am a nature lover who also likes to play sports which makes me fitter, healthier and happier as a person.

I believe team work is the key to success for any project. Hence along with technical abilities, I think the soft skill are a major part of person's life and need to be developed too.

As of now I am currently working on full stack developement and android development along with good hold on data structures and algorithms.
