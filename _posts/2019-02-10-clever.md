> **Artificial Intelligence based web application which will test the aptitude of a child. CAT is implemented using Item Response Theory which will dynamically select question according to the examineeâ€™s ability level. Machine Learning concepts are used to categorize the questions.**

The Aptitude test is based on Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligence according to which human intelligence is classified into eight different categories, rather than seeing it dominated by a single general ability.

> The Front end is built on Bootstrap 4.0 which displays the questions fetched from the firebase databse.
This is how the site looks like:

The algorithm used is as follows:
1. **Initialize score level:** Set score = 0 and level which is difficulty = 0.
2. **Calculate theta:** Here theta means score after each question is answered which will be used to calculate the difficulty level of the next question.
3. **Calculate Item Response Function:** Using current difficulty level and score calculate IRF, probability for each level and information value.
4. **Administer Item and record response:** Store the values.
5. **Repeat steps 2 to 4:** This has to be done util the stopping criteria is reached that is maximum test length is reached or the ability measure is estimated with sufficient precision.
6. **Calculate final score:** Final score is calculated based on all the responses.

The grah of variation of information function w.r.t score looks like:
